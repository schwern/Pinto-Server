    Now sends all log messages (at any level) to the client.  It
    is up to the client to decide which ones it wants to record
    or display.

    If using Starman or Twiggy, Pinto will abort gracefully
    if the connection with the client is dropped (like if
    you press Ctrl-C when using pinto-remote).

    Now requires Pinto 0.036 which has a different interface
    for controlling where log messages go (Inspired by
    Karen Etheridge).

    Added Authen::Simple::Passwd as test prereq to fix build failures
    (Thanks CPAN Testers!)

    New Features:

    pinto-server can now be configured to require authentication.
    Authentication can be done using any of the Authen::Simple
    modules.  See the POD for details.  If you use this feature, then
    you'll also need to use a version of pinto-remote that
    supports authentication.  (Karen Etheridge)

    pinto-server now streams back the output from Actions.  You will
    need to use a backend server that supports streaming for this to
    work (e.g. Starman, Twiggy, etc.)  Fortunatley, the default
    backend (HTTP::Server::PSGI) does support streaming.

    Other Stuff:

    Pinto::Server has been completely redesigned into a simple web
    application micro-framework.  This eliminates our dependency on
    Dancer (not that there is anything wrong with Dancer.  I just
    needed something a little less frameworky).

    In theory, Pinto::Server now scales to support any future Action
    without having to write any additional code here.  As long as your
    Action follows convention and behaves properly, then the server
    will just do-the-right-thing.

0.034     2012-03-17 08:47:01 America/Los_Angeles

    Bug Fixes:

    pinto-server had a broken shebang.

0.033     2012-03-17 00:59:47 America/Los_Angeles

    Support the --norecurse option in the add command (Karen
    Etheridge) which also requires Pinto-0.033 or newer.

0.029     2012-01-26 22:25:06 America/Los_Angeles

    The --repos option on pinto-server has been officially renamed to
    --root.  This is to be consistent with the interfaces of
    pinto-admin and pinto-remote.  The old --repos option will not be
    supported for backward compatibility.

0.028     2011-12-12 00:23:45 America/Los_Angeles

    Exceptions from Pinto are now trapped and returned in the body of
    the response from the server.  This is more helpful than the 500
    error page that Dancer throws up.

    Added support for the statistics, pin, and unpin actions.  So
    we now need Pinto version 0.028 or better.

0.026     2011-12-07 14:09:41 America/Los_Angeles

    No new functionality.  Just matching up with the latest Pinto API.
    Pinto and Pinto::Server are both evolving rapidly, and I make no
    promises about backward compatibility right now.

0.021     2011-09-03 21:43:25 America/Los_Angeles

    Addd the nop route.  This is used by the 'ping' command of
    pinto-remote.

0.020     2011-09-01 15:29:40 America/Los_Angeles

    Now requires Pinto 0.23, which has a different interface.

    Refactored internals so they could be tested.

    And then I actually wrote the tests!

0.019     2011-08-30 01:14:43 America/Los_Angeles

    Now requires Pinto 0.021, which behaves better in a server
    environment.  I thought I had fixed this in version 0.017, but I
    was wrong.

0.018     2011-08-28 20:59:15 America/Los_Angeles

    Now required Pinto 0.020, which supports the Nop action.

    pinto-server will now always pull/update your repository from VCS
    upon startup.  This helps ensure that the repository is in a good
    state when we start.  But we never pull/update again after that.

0.017     2011-08-24 00:24:17 America/Los_Angeles

    Now requires Pinto 0.017 or newer, which runs better under a
    server environment.

    All the guts of Pinto::Server are now in pinto-server, as this
    seemed to be the only way to integrate my Dancer routes with my
    own command-line switches without having to use Dancer's own
    configuration API.  I'm quite sure that I'm not using Dancer the
    way it is intended.

0.001     2011-08-17 01:04:58 America/Los_Angeles

    Initial release.
